				<span>Brown rice !!!</span><br> 
				The vitamins, minerals and antioxidants are some of the benefits, but one of the biggest pluses may be that the high amount of fiber in brown rice helps slow digestion and fill you up for a long time. <br><br>

				"Fiber is one of the best [nutritional components] that helps with satiety, or the feeling of fullness," says Rachel Begun, a food and nutrition consultant in Boulder, Colo. <br>"They also help to spread the food dollar because they're a component of meals that can help you make a fulfilling dish."<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beans!!!</span> <br> 
				Like many items at the grocery store, buying in bulk can save a lot of money. <br>Dry beans can cost about $1 per pound and expand to three times their volume when cooked, turning three to four cups of dry beans into nine cups when cooked, says Carol Wasserman, a certified holistic health practitioner in Manhattan. <br><br>

				And beans, like rice, can be flavored with spices and herbs to make the main portion of a meal. <br><br>

				"We have to kind of shift our thinking from having the meat be the center of the plate," and be more creative with other dishes, such as rice and beans, says Julieanna Hever, a plant-based dietician in Los Angeles and host of a healthy living talk show on Veria Living. <br><br>

				Beans are also a very healthy choice. <br> They are high in fiber and protein, low in fat and sodium and have minerals such as iron, potassium, magnesium, copper and zinc, along with vitamins such as folic acid, thiamin, niacin and B6. <br><br>


			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Potatoes!!!</span><br>
				These versatile vegetables can be added to casseroles and used in a variety of ways, and they're every bit as nutritious as colored vegetables, Begun says. <br>They contain 45 percent of the recommended daily nutritional intake of vitamin C, 18 percent of fiber and 18 percent of potassium, a mineral that regulates blood pressure, she says. <br>They've been found to have the lowest cost source of dietary potassium. <br><br>

				The average potato is virtually fat free, with a high water and fiber content to make it ideal for weight-loss at 200 calories for an average baked potato, according to information from GoIreland.com. <br>Be careful how you cook them. Frying a potato raises fat content from 0 to 8 grams. <br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Peanut butter!!!</span> <br>
				This is another economic source of protein, rich in healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. <br>Peanuts contain resveratrol, an antioxidant found in red wine, says Sharon Palmer, a Duarte, Calif.-based food and nutrition writer who covers plant-powered diets.
